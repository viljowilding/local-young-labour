# Local Young Labour

A tool I developed to allow Young Labour members to find their local Young Labour group & their CLP's youth officer. Uses [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io) to organise Postcode data, [thanks to ryryan's Postcodes.io PHP Class](https://github.com/ryryan/Postcodes-IO-PHP).

This tool can be seen live (with very limited test data - try "IG1 1DT" and "N2 8DT") [here](https://viljo.me/local-young-labour/).
